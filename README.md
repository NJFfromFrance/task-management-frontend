# Task Management Application Front-end

This application acts as the front-end for the Task Management application developed throughout the *NestJS - Zero to Hero* course, produced by Ariel Weinberger.

Summary of changes by NJF:
In the api I used the routes 'register' and 'login' iso 'signup' and 'signin', and 'token' iso 'accessToken': changed in src/services/auth.service.js.
Furthermore sass is not working, so I have changed all *.scss to *.css and also changed the relevant import statements (all in src/pages).
